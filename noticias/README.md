The free version of this API does not allow CORS when the site has been published. CORS will only work on localhost for free accounts.  

For use, you will get an API KEY from [this website](https://newsapi.org/register). Then create a `.env` file in your root directory with the next code:  

`REACT_APP_API_KEY = "YOUR APIKEY HERE"`
